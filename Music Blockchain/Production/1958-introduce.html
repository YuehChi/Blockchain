    <h1>Extra-Special Edition</h1>
    <h3>Gibson Custom Shop is the pinnacle of craftsmanship, quality, and sound excellence. Each instrument celebrates Gibson's legacy through accuracy, authenticity and attention to detail.</h3>
    <h3>The Les Paul Junior and Special were revised in 1958 to have double cutaways and more fingerboard access, but the Special didn't really hit its groove until 1960, when the lower pickup placement and slim neck taper made it more robust and easier to play than ever. Custom Shop has proudly replicated the Cherry Red and TV Yellow originals in intricate detail with these 1960 Les Paul Special Double Cut Reissues. They are complete structural and visual clones of the coveted vintage counterparts, but the real magic is in their identical sound and playability. A pair of mean, fiery P-90s create tones ranging from sparkling cleans to crunchy distortion. Anything you throw at it, this Les Paul can handle!</h3>
